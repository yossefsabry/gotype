⚠️ Minor Issues to Consider
1. Render Still Called Every 80ms
The ticker still runs at 12fps even when nothing changed. You could:
- Only render when needsRender is true (which you do)
- Remove the if needsRender check from main loop (already there ✅)
Actually, looking at app.go:84-88, you're doing this correctly! ✅
2. Review Mode Calls buildLines Directly
In review.go:8, ScrollReview(), ReviewTop(), ReviewBottom() - all call buildLines() directly instead of using the cache.
Fix: Use model.linesForWidth(model.Layout.TextWidth) instead.
3. Benchmark Doesn't Test Cache
The BenchmarkRender doesn't type any characters, so targetVersion stays at 0 and cache is always valid. Not a real issue, just FYI.
